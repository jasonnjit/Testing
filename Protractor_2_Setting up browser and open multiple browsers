Testing against multiple browsers


1. In the protractor.conf.js file, in capabilities, replace the browerName line with two or more browserName lines, like below.


capabilities: {
	'browserName': 'firefox'
  },



multiCapabilities: [{
  'browserName': 'firefox'
}, {
  'browserName': 'chrome'
}]

If you would rather have each test file just run once, but split up among multiple browsers, then use the splitTestsBetweenCapabilities option:

splitTestsBetweenCapabilities: true
