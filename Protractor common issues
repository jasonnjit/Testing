                                    'browserstack.local': 'true'
                                  },
                                   

    node-modules                  browserstack-webdriver
    
    package.json                  "browserstack-webdriver": "2.41.1"
    
    In trunk/test/                BrowserStackLocal.exe   


2. fatal error: protractor exited with code: 8

Solution:
  1. Selenium should use JDK, rather than JRE, so install JDK. 
  2. Update environment variables, add JAVA_HOME(location of JDK, the upper level of JDK' bin file location), 
  and Path(JDK bin location). Then, close cmd, reopen a cmd. Find Java -version changed to JDK's location.
  3. This solution worked the problem out, but there are still problems while running "grunt test:e2e", try to 
  find if these are test files' problems.
  4. Also, it is still coming out the fatal error: protractor exited with code: 8
