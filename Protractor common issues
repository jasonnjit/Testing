Protractor common issues

1. Settings for local testing & BrowserStack automation testing
  
  protractor.conf.js              Selenium Address
                                  seleniumAddress: 'http://hub.browserstack.com/wd/hub',
                                    
                                  capabilities: {
                                	'browser': 'firefox',
                                    'brrowser_version': '31.0',
                                    'os': 'Windows',
                                    'os_version': '7',
                                    'browserstack.user': 'username',
                                    'browserstack.key': 'access key',
                                    'browserstack.local': 'true'
                                  },
                                   

    node-modules                  browserstack-webdriver
    
    package.json                  "browserstack-webdriver": "2.41.1"
    
    In trunk/test/                BrowserStackLocal.exe   


2. fatal error: protractor exited with code: 8

Solution:
  1. Selenium should use JDK, rather than JRE, so install JDK. 
  2. Update environment variables, add JAVA_HOME(location of JDK, the upper level of JDK' bin file location), 
  and Path(JDK bin location). Then, close cmd, reopen a cmd. Find Java -version changed to JDK's location.
  3. This solution worked the problem out, but there are still problems while running "grunt test:e2e", try to 
  find if these are test files' problems.
  4. Also, it is still coming out the fatal error: protractor exited with code: 8


3. Testing against multiple browsers

  3.1. In the protractor.conf.js file, in capabilities, replace the browerName line with two or more browserName lines, like below.

    3.1.1 Only one browser
      capabilities: {
    	'browserName': 'firefox'
      },

    3.1.2 Multiple browsers
    multiCapabilities: [{
      'browserName': 'firefox'
    }, {
      'browserName': 'chrome'
    }]
    --------------ie is not starting now----------------

  3.2. Check link below.
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20692008/protractor-run-multiple-tests-in-parallel-on-different-browsers
  
    If you would rather have each test file just run once, but split up among multiple browsers, then use the splitTestsBetweenCapabilities option:
    
    splitTestsBetweenCapabilities: true
    This blog post goes into further detail about the splitTestsBetweenCapabilities
    
    Also, here is a reference protractor.conf.js from Angular team.

4. current url
  4.1. get the current url when we click the menu and redirect us to the website out of our app
    Ex:
    The logo 
    This is issue is finally fixed. Use browser.driver.getCurrentUrl();
    So, we can get the Url non-angular.
  
  4.2. get current url inside the app 
    Ex: 
    login function, like below
    
    it('should allow user1 to login', function () {
                var expectUrl = ptor.baseUrl + '/#/landing';
                loginPage.login('username', 'password');
                ptor.sleep(10000);
                expect(ptor.getCurrentUrl()).toBe(expectUrl);
    
    //            expect(element(by.id('home')).isDisplayed()).toBe(true);
            });
