How to automation test on SauceLabs:

1. In Protractor conf.js file, add:
  sauceUser: 'jhao',
  sauceKey: 'xxxxxxxxxx',
  
  Be careful with those multiCapabilities, they should look like below. The names should be same with those names in 
  this link. (https://saucelabs.com/platforms/webdriver) We should use WebDriver and nodejs!!!
  
        {   "name":"Chrome",
            "browserName": "googlechrome",
            "platform": "Windows 7",
            "browser-version": "37"}
        ,
        
        {   "name":"FF",
            'browserName': 'firefox',
            'platform': "Windows 7",
            'version': '33'
        }
