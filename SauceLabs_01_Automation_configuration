How to automation test on SauceLabs:

1. In Protractor conf.js file, add:
  sauceUser: 'jhao',
  sauceKey: 'xxxxxxxxxx',
  
  Be careful with those multiCapabilities, which should look like below. The names should be same with those names in 
  this link. (https://saucelabs.com/platforms/webdriver) Use WebDriver and nodejs!!!
  
        {"name":"Chrome",
         "browserName": "chrome",
         "platform": "Windows 7",
         "version": "37"}
