Met problem as below.

fatal error: protractor exited with code: 8

Solution:
1. Selenium should use JDK, rather than JRE, so install JDK. 
2. Update environment variables, add JAVA_HOME(location of JDK, the upper level of JDK' bin file location), 
and Path(JDK bin location). Then, close cmd, reopen a cmd. Find Java -version changed to JDK's location.
3. This solution worked the problem out, but there are still problems while running "grunt test:e2e", try to 
find if these are test files' problems.
4. Also, it is still coming out the fatal error: protractor exited with code: 8
